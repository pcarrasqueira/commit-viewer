# Commit Viewer 

Commit-viewer is a Quarkus project that list commits for a given user and repository. 
It has one paginated endpoint exposed at
`http://localhost:8080/commit-viewer/{user}/{repo}`. 
You can check the open-api documentation of the endpoint using Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/api-docs/`

Commit Viewer uses by default the GitHub API in order to fetch the commits or, in case of failure, the git cli. 
You can force the use of the CLI with property :
```
commit-viewer.force-use-cli=true
```
Database support was added, now firs time we fetch commits for a repo, we will save the data to database. Subsequent requests
will fetch the data directly from database.


In order to increase resiliency of the application, retries, timeouts and fallbacks were implemented using [SmallRye Fault Tolerance](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/)
priveded by Quarkus. You can configure the fault tolerance values on application.properties, eg :
```
Timeout/value=5 // set timeout value to 5 globally
Timeout/unit=MINUTES // set MINUTES as the time unit globally
com.challenge.web.impl.CommitViewerResourceImpl/getCommitList/Timeout/value=5 // set timeout value to 5 for getCommitList method.
```

Checkstyle validation is active on build phase and is using a checker based on [sun_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/sun_checks.xml)
